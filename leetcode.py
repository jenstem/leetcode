# Reverse Vowels of a String #345

# Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

# The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "IceCreAm"

# Output: "AceCreIm"

# Explanation:

# The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "leetcode"

# Output: "leotcede"

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
# s consist of printable ASCII characters.

    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1
        cs = list(s)
        while i < j:
            while i < j and cs[i] not in vowels:
                i += 1
            while i < j and cs[j] not in vowels:
                j -= 1
            if i < j:
                cs[i], cs[j] = cs[j], cs[i]
                i, j = i + 1, j - 1
        return "".join(cs)
