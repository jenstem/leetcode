# Long Pressed Name #925

# Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

# You examine the typed characters of the keyboard. Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
# Output: true
# Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
# Example 2:

# Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
# Output: false
# Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= name.length, typed.length <= 1000
# name and typed consist of only lowercase English letters.

        m, n = len(name), len(typed)
        i = j = 0
        while i < m and j < n:
            if name[i] != typed[j]:
                return False
            x = i + 1
            while x < m and name[x] == name[i]:
                x += 1
            y = j + 1
            while y < n and typed[y] == typed[j]:
                y += 1
            if x - i > y - j:
                return False
            i, j = x, y
        return i == m and j == n
