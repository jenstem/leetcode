# Fruits into Baskets II #3477

# You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.

# From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

# Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
# Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
# If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.
# Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

        n = len(fruits)
        vis = [False] * n
        ans = n
        for x in fruits:
            for i, y in enumerate(baskets):
                if y >= x and not vis[i]:
                    vis[i] = True
                    ans -= 1
                    break
        return ans
